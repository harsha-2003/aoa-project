AOA Project – LLM Prompts Appendix
Course: COT5405 – Analysis of Algorithms
Authors: Harshavardhan Reddy Jonnala, Tanuja Naga Sai Palapati
Tool Used: OpenAI GPT-5 (ChatGPT, October 2025)

Purpose:
The LLM was used strictly for LaTeX structuring, IEEE formatting assistance,
and debugging Python benchmarking scripts. No theoretical proofs or
algorithmic reasoning were generated without manual verification.
All code and mathematical results were reviewed and validated by the authors.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 1:
"I want to create an IEEE-style LaTeX report template for my AOA project.
Please give me the basic structure with title, authors, abstract, and sections."

Response Summary:
Generated a minimal IEEEtran template with placeholders for sections and correct
\documentclass and package setup for Overleaf compatibility.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 2:
"I am getting a LaTeX error about 'Undefined control sequence' in \IEEEauthorblockA.
Please fix the author and title formatting for two authors and one course name."

Response Summary:
GPT provided corrected syntax with escaped special characters (double backslashes)
and fixed missing braces for the author block.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 3:
"Give me pseudocode formatting in LaTeX for a greedy algorithm using algorithmic package."

Response Summary:
Returned correct environment usage for \begin{algorithm} and \begin{algorithmic}
including numbered lines, \State, and \If constructs.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 4:
"My LaTeX figure is not showing up; I used \includegraphics but it’s blank in PDF.
How to correctly reference images stored in a data/ folder?"

Response Summary:
Suggested including \graphicspath{{data/}} and using \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{filename.png}.
This fixed missing image rendering.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 5:
"I am getting 'File IO failure' and 'Syntax error' in my Gleam build; 
help me understand why file not found occurs in Python benchmarking scripts."

Response Summary:
Explained that outputs were saved to the current working directory, not the data/ folder,
and added os.makedirs('../data', exist_ok=True) to fix output path errors.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 6:
"Generate Python code to benchmark the greedy and divide-and-conquer algorithms
and plot runtime vs n log n reference using matplotlib and pandas."

Response Summary:
Produced runnable Python scripts with randomized test data, time measurement,
CSV export, and properly labeled plots saved in the data folder.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prompt 7:
"I want to compress my AOA project with LaTeX, code, and images into one final ZIP
for submission. Create organized folder structure and file names."

Response Summary:
GPT suggested folder structure:
AOA_Project_Report.tex, code/, data/, appendix/ with LLM_prompts.txt,
and generated final ZIP packaging instructions.
